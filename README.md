Description
=============

A Chatroom app built using node.js

This is a sample chatroom app built using node to understand the socket.io API and also the real time capabilities of node.
No framework has been used in building this project.


The chatroom doesnt have persistent memory so any previous chat is lost. Also refreshing during a chat will lead to loss of chat history as refreshing leads to new connection (No use of cookies). 

A user can only see those messages that are sent after his arrival.
